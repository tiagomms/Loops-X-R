# Sample Assets Management

## Overview
This document tracks the sample assets used in the project, their modifications, and their locations.

## Sample Assets Structure
```
Assets/
├── Samples/              # Original samples (gitignored)
└── UsedSamples/         # Modified samples in use
    ├── [Category1]/
    │   └── [Asset1]
    └── [Category2]/
        └── [Asset2]
```

## Used Sample Assets
| Asset Name | Original Location | Current Location | Modifications Made | Usage |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| [To be filled as samples are used] | | | | |

## Modification Guidelines
1. When using a sample asset:
   - Copy it to `UsedSamples/[Category]/[AssetName]`
   - Document it in this README
   - Make necessary modifications
   - Update the documentation with changes

2. When modifying a sample:
   - Keep original functionality intact
   - Document all changes
   - Test thoroughly
   - Update this README

## Version Control
- Original samples in `Samples/` remain in `.gitignore`
- Modified samples in `UsedSamples/` are tracked
- This README is tracked to maintain documentation

## Notes
- Add any special considerations here
- Document any known issues
- List any dependencies between samples
